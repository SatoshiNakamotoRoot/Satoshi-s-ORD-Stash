  "description":"These Ordinals inscriptions are stills from a video titled “6:32:11 of MPEG Flow” (2004) by jugnetclairet.\nThey are durable, immutable, secure and decentralized data stored directly on Bitcoin.\n\n“We asked engineers at an electronics company if it were possible to create an interface that would show the way pictures looked as they traveled through optical fibers, after being encoded and before being decoded.\nOur aim was to make the raw flow of data visible, to create a visual reality that transcended encoding into 0s and 1s.\nAt the time we felt that this question of the transmission of pictures via optical fibers and satellites addressed a real economic issue of our day, namely the management and redistribution of packets of time.\nFor us, art creates a distanced world, a critical sphere in relation to ongoing technological, economical and political issues of the day, for which it proposes new meanings”.
