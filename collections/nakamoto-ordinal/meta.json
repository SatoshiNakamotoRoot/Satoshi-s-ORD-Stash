  "description": "Rare Pepe The Nakamoto Card on ordinals truly embodies the phrase "The Token is the Art". This collection is the byte perfect artifact representing the RAREPEPE Nakamoto asset.Out of the 300 original XCP tokens at most 298 are still in circulation with many of them not being moved in years unknown to the public as to whether they are lost.Investors and collectors are now speculating on the first 298 RAREPEPE byte perfect ordinal inscriptions, which will likely be known as one of the most rare and valuable inscription collections due to the prestige and nature of the RAREPEPE derivative assets in the collectibles markets.",
