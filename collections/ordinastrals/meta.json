{"name":"Ordinastrals","slug":"ordinastrals","supply":"69","description":"Ordinastrals is a collection of 69 portraits for connoisseurs - All inscribed exclusively on special satoshis - These genesis portraits are the gateways to my next free mints - This collection is about Astral Projections exploring the Ordinals realm. Astral Projections assume the existence of an Astral body, through which consciousness can function separately from the physical body and travel throughout the Astral Plane. These portraits are like us, Ordinals explorers, adventurers going on a journey, looking for the special grail, making frens, new connections, discovering special sats, learning about the history of satoshis, and scarcity of some, finding the perfect portraits for one's PFP, making some more frens, travelling and exploring new meta realms, always learning and having fun. That is what matters. That is what is important, and that is what will last forever. Each portrait convey different feelings, inspired by our thirst for quest of unlimited possibilities. These feelings and memories last forever, like the inscriptions on BTC.","twitter_link":"https://twitter.com/SasugaRackham","discord_link":"","website_link":"","inscription_icon":"89cd6c14c4cf0f19d160ba5341afbe6138299268297955e09642d116689b640ai0"}
