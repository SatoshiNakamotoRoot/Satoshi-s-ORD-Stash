Past McDonalds, past Goblintown, all the way to the dump. Brought to life as living piles of trash, 9582 Rotten Anti Social Club knew that it was time for the garbage to take charge!</p><p>They set up housekeeping in Zero Valley, running an entire city on banana peels, garbage juice and the joyful abandon that comes with the understanding that everything in the entire world is worthless trash. But then, deep in the chaotic archives of the municipal government of Zero Valley, the chief executive Horripilation Q Slime discoveredâ€¦a MAP!</p><p>The plan? To find and follow the path, past towering piles of ancient garbage, to plumb the most fetid depths, and step through the Fateful Gates with 420 new friends into TRASHALLA!</p>",
